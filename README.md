# Project: To-Do-List

ToDo List application is a text based user interface. 
It models a task with a task title, due date, status and project. 
The collection of tasks is sorted by date and Project name. It uses text file for storing and retrieving task. 
The application allows a user to create new tasks, show task, add new task, update task, remove task, mark as done and save the task. 
The user can also quit and save the current task to file, and then restart the application with the former state restored.

# Platform

▪ IntelliJ Idea 2020.2.1

▪	Java 8

▪	Text file for storing data


# The project uses Gradle

Gradle can be thought of as goodness of Maven and Ant put together minus the noise of XML. And scriptability with groovy is very big plus.

▪ Gradle gives you conventions but still gives you power to override them easily.

▪ Gradle build files are less verbose as they are written in groovy.

▪ It provides very nice DSL(Domain-specific language) for writing build tasks.

▪ Support and Access to other build tools and its repositories.


# Testing
